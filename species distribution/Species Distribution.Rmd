Species Information

The Saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) is a columnar cactus endemic to the Sonoran Desert (western Sonora Desert and southern Arizona). It is considered a keystone species because of how many species rely on all the different life stages of the plant for food, nesting, shade, etc. There is increasing fears of population collapse because of invasive grass species which are encouraging a fire regime which Saguaro cacti did not evolve to experience. As the climate warms, and grasses invade, saguaro cacti populations are expected to decline. Thus, it is critically important to understand the species distribution to inform and direct conservation and restoration efforts.

##Statistical Analysis
###Bioclim
BIOCLIM is an algorithm is a very useful modeling method used for species distribution. 
The algorith relies on constraining 
The BIOCLIM algorithm has been extensively used for species distribution modeling. BIOCLIM is a classic ‘climate-envelope-model’ (Booth et al., 2014). Although it generally does not perform as good as some other modeling methods (Elith et al. 2006), particularly in the context of climate change (Hijmans and Graham, 2006), it is still used, among other reasons because the algorithm is easy to understand and thus useful in teaching species distribution modeling. The BIOCLIM algorithm computes the similarity of a location by comparing the values of environmental variables at any location to a percentile distribution of the values at known locations of occurrence (‘training sites’). The closer to the 50th percentile (the median), the more suitable the location is. The tails of the distribution are not distinguished, that is, 10 percentile is treated as equivalent to 90 percentile. In the ‘dismo’ implementation, the values of the upper tail values are transformed to the lower tail, and the minimum percentile score across all the environmental variables is used (i.e., BIOCLIM uses an approach like Liebig’s law of the minimum). This value is subtracted from 1 and then multiplied with two so that the results are between 0 and 1. The reason for scaling this way is that the results become more like that of other distribution modeling methods and are thus easier to interpret. The value 1 will rarely be observed as it would require a location that has the median value of the training data for all the variables considered. The value 0 is very common as it is assigned to all cells with a value of an environmental variable that is outside the percentile distribution (the range of the training data) for at least one of the variables.
